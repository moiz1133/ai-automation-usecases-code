# AI Invoice Processor

This use case demonstrates how AI can automatically extract structured
data from invoices, replacing manual data entry.

Accounting teams manually extract fields.

## Solution
Use AI to convert invoice text into structured JSON.

## Extracted Fields
- Vendor
- Invoice number
- Date
- Currency
- Subtotal
- Tax
- Total

## How to run
1. Add your OpenAI API key
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the script

## Business Impact
- Manual time per invoice: ~10 minutes
- AI processing time: ~10 seconds
- Error reduction: Significant
